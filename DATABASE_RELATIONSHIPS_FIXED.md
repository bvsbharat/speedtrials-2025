# Database Relationships - Fixed and Validated

## Summary
Successfully resolved foreign key constraint validation issues and established proper relationships between all 10 database tables.

## Fixed Issues
1. **Removed conflicting RLS policies** that were causing duplicate policy errors
2. **Established proper foreign key constraints** between related tables
3. **Created analysis views** for easier data querying and relationships

## Current Database Schema with Relationships

### Core Tables and Their Relationships

#### 1. **water_systems** (Central Hub)
- **Primary Key**: `pwsid`
- **Related Tables**: All other tables reference this via `pwsid`
- **Fields**: `pws_name`, `pws_type_code`, `population_served_count`

#### 2. **violations**
- **Foreign Key**: `pwsid` → `water_systems(pwsid)`
- **Unique Key**: `violation_id`
- **Key Fields**: `violation_code`, `contaminant_code`, `is_health_based_ind`

#### 3. **sample_results**
- **Foreign Key**: `pwsid` → `water_systems(pwsid)`
- **Key Fields**: `contaminant_code`, `sample_measure`, `mcl`, `exceeds_mcl`
- **Relationship**: Links to violations via `pwsid` + `contaminant_code`

#### 4. **facilities**
- **Foreign Key**: `pwsid` → `water_systems(pwsid)`
- **Key Fields**: `facility_id`, `facility_name`

#### 5. **geographic_areas**
- **Foreign Key**: `pwsid` → `water_systems(pwsid)`
- **Key Fields**: Geographic boundary information

#### 6. **site_visits**
- **Foreign Key**: `pwsid` → `water_systems(pwsid)`
- **Key Fields**: Visit dates and inspection data

#### 7. **service_areas**
- **Foreign Key**: `pwsid` → `water_systems(pwsid)`
- **Key Fields**: `service_area_type_code`

#### 8. **pn_violation_assoc**
- **Foreign Key 1**: `pwsid` → `water_systems(pwsid)`
- **Foreign Key 2**: `related_violation_id` → `violations(violation_id)`
- **Purpose**: Links public notification violations to specific violations

#### 9. **events_milestones**
- **Foreign Key**: `pwsid` → `water_systems(pwsid)`
- **Key Fields**: `event_schedule_id`, milestone tracking

#### 10. **ref_code_values**
- **Purpose**: Reference/lookup table for codes used across other tables
- **Key Fields**: `value_type`, `value_code`, `value_description`
- **No direct FK**: Used for code validation and descriptions

## Analysis Views Created

### 1. **water_system_analysis**
Comprehensive view showing:
- Water system details
- Total violations count
- Health-based violations count
- Total samples count
- Total facilities count

```sql
SELECT * FROM water_system_analysis WHERE total_violations > 0;
```

### 2. **violations_with_samples**
Joins violations with related sample results:
- Violation details
- Related sample measurements
- MCL exceedances
- Water system names

```sql
SELECT * FROM violations_with_samples 
WHERE exceeds_mcl = true AND is_health_based_ind = true;
```

## Key Relationships for Analysis

### 1. **Violation-Sample Analysis**
```sql
-- Find violations with related sample exceedances
SELECT v.*, sr.sample_measure, sr.mcl
FROM violations v
JOIN sample_results sr ON v.pwsid = sr.pwsid AND v.contaminant_code = sr.contaminant_code
WHERE sr.exceeds_mcl = true;
```

### 2. **Water System Risk Assessment**
```sql
-- Systems with multiple health-based violations
SELECT ws.pws_name, COUNT(*) as health_violations
FROM water_systems ws
JOIN violations v ON ws.pwsid = v.pwsid
WHERE v.is_health_based_ind = true
GROUP BY ws.pwsid, ws.pws_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 3. **Geographic Analysis**
```sql
-- Violations by geographic area
SELECT ga.*, COUNT(v.violation_id) as violation_count
FROM geographic_areas ga
LEFT JOIN violations v ON ga.pwsid = v.pwsid
GROUP BY ga.pwsid;
```

## Benefits of Fixed Relationships

1. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
2. **Query Performance**: Proper indexes on relationship columns
3. **Analysis Capabilities**: Easy joins between related data
4. **Validation**: Prevents orphaned records
5. **Reporting**: Comprehensive views for dashboard and analytics

## Next Steps

1. **Data Upload**: All tables now ready for CSV data import
2. **Dashboard Integration**: Views can be used directly in React components
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Complex queries across multiple tables now possible
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Indexes in place for optimal query performance

The database is now fully configured with proper relationships and ready for production use!
